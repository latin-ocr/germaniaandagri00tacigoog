drus gran too inths antithetis clauses (frons or asteriam
aad byin the other), is scarcely to be endured, and be seems
not altogether averse to the conjectural reading opud se ipsos for
a se ipsis. The antithesis doubtless requires o to be understood
in the same sense in both clauses. Grirber translates and
explains thus: “ ln this way, the name oi a single tribe, and not
ol the whole ponpis, has come into use, so that all, atlirst by
the victor (the Tungri), in order to inspira isar, then by
themselves (by the mouth of the whole people)‚ when once the
namo became known were called by the name of Germane.
That is, the Tungri called all the kindred tribes, that dwelt
beyond the Rhine Germane, in order to inspire sear by the wide
extension ol the name, since they gave themselves out to be a
part os so vasta people3 but at length all the tribes began to
call themselves by this name, probably because they were
pieased to see the sear which it cxcited.’' This'is, on the
whole, the most satisfactory explanation oi the passage. K.
proposes cognationis lor natiortis Germani. ll os German etymo-
logy, this word=gehr or wehr (Fr. guerre) and mann, rnna of
war‚· hence the mnus, which the name carried with it. If it
isa Latin word correspondingonly in· serare with ths on'ginel
German, thsn=bretbrna lt will bo seen, that either etymology
would accord with Grliber's explanation oi the whole passage-
in either case, the name tvould inspire sear.

Motum. Here talen in an actico sense3 altener passive, but
used in both senses. Quintilian speaks of mcum duplicem,
quem patimur et quem facimus (6, ⁴2, 21). cf.-A. 44: nihil
metus in vultu, i. e., nothing to inspiro sear iu his countenancs.
ln lilre manner admiratio (i t) is used for the admiration which
one excites, though it usually denotes the admiration which ono
leels.

Nationis-gentis. Gens is oiton used by Τ. as a synonym with
notio, But in antithesis, gene is the whole, of which nationes
or populi are the parts. e. g. G. 4. populos-gentsn13 i 14:
nationes-genti. In like manner, in the civil constitution ol
Mune, agens included several related samius.
