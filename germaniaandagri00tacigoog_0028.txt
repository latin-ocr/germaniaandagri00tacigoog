Simple narrative no longer suited the pampered taeta of the

readers or the writers of history. It must be highly seasoned
with seutinrentalism aad moralizing, with romanoe aud poetry.
Tacitus, certainly, did not escape the iniection. ln the lan·
guage of Macaulay, “ He carries his love ol effect lar beyond

point out not a lew examples of rhetorical pomp, and poetical
coloring, aud even needless multiplicatiori of words, where
plainness and precision would have been much better, and
which may well surprise us in a writer of so much oonciseuesa.
Lord Monboddo, in every able, though somewhat extravagant
critique on Tacitus, has selected numerous instances oi what
he calls the omamented dry style, many of which are so concise,
so rough and so broken, that he says, they do not deserve tha
name ol composition, but seem rather like the raw materials ot*
history, than like history itselt (Orig. and Prog. of Lang, vol.
iii chap. 12).

Still, lew readers can fail to pronounce Tacitus, as Macaulay
affirma, and even Lord Monboddo admits him to be, the greatest

moral painting of his best narrative scenas, and in the delinea-
tion ot character without a rival among historiens, with scarcely

asuperior among dramatists aad novelists. The common style
ol his sanative is, indeed, wanting in simplicity, and some·
times in perspicuity. He does not deal enough in the specitic

when his subject eomes up to the grandeur of his conceptione,
