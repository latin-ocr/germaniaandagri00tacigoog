severity. The punctuation is the result of a diligent comparisou
of the hest editione, together with a careful study of the con·
nexiones language aud of thought.

The German editions above mentioned, together with several
French, English, and American works, have not only been con·
stautly before une, but have been used with great freedom, aud
credit awarded to thern accordingly. Some may think their
names should have appeared less frequentiy; others that they
should have received eredit to a still greater extent. Suffice it
to say, Ι have never intended tn quote the lauguage‚ or borrow
the thoughts of an author, without giving his uame; and in mat·
ters of fact or opinion, I have cited euthorities not only when 1
have been iudebted to thern for the suggestion, but whenever, in
a case of coincidence of views, I thought the authorities would
be of any interest to the student.

I have not considered it needful, with German scrupulosity, to
distinguish between my own references and those of others. It
may safely be taken for granted, thet the major, perhaps the bet-

will be found pertinent and useful, whether illustrative of things, '

or of mere verbal usage. Some, who use the boolr, will doubtless
find occasion to follow thern out either in whole or in purt3 and>
those who do not, will gain a general impression as to the sources
from which collateral information may be obtained, that will be
of uo small value.

The frequent references to the Notes of Professor Kiugsley,
will show the estimation iu which 1 hold them. Perhaps l have·
used them too freely. My only apology is, that so far as they
go, they are just what is wanbed3 aud if Ι had avoided using
them to a considerable extent, I murt have substituted something
less perfectos my own. Had they been more copious, and
extended more to verba] and grammatical illustratione, these
Notes never would have appeared.

The editoris convinced, from his experience as a teacher,
that the student of Tacitus will not master the difficulties, or
appreciate the merite, of so peculiar an author, unless his
