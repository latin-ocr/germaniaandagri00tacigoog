Venia opus fuit. This whole passage has greatly perplexed
the critice. The text is disputed‚ and it is not agreed why Τ.
aslis indulgence. Br. Dr, and others say, he aslis indulgence
herthe inferiority oi his style and manner (incondito ac mat,
voce, 3), as compared with the distinguished authors (wicque
celeberrimus) oi an earlier and better age. But there would
have been no less occasion to apologiae ior that, ii the times he
wrote of had not been sc hostile to virtue. Hertel, La Bletterie
and many French critics understand, that he apologizes for writ-
ingthe memoir of his rather-in-law so late (navic), when he was
already dead (defuncti), instead ol doing it, as the great men os a
former day did, while the subject ol their memoirs was yet alive3
and he pleads in justification oi the delay, that he could not have
written it earlier without encountering the dangers oi that crnel
age (the age oi Domitian). This makes a very good sense.
The only objection against it is, that the language opus fuit seems
ratberto imply that it was necessary to justiiy himself for writing
ir at all, hy citing the examples os former distinguished writers
oi biography‚ as he had dovre in the soregoing Introduction. But
why would it have been annecessary to apologiae for writing
the lise oi Α., it the times in which he lived, had not been so
unfriendly to virtue? Because then A. would have had oppor-
tunity to achieve victuries arrd honore, which would have
madoci narration, but for which the Jealousy and cruelty oi
Domitian now gave no scope. This is the explanation of R,
and he supports it by reference to the fact, that the achievements
ol A. in the conquestos Britain, though doubtless just as Τ. has
described them, yet occupy so small a space in general history,
that they are not even mentioned hy any ancient historiari
except Dio Cassius ; and he mentions them chiefly out os regard
to the discovery made by Α., for the first time, that Britain was
an island, Vid. R. Exc. 1.

This explanation answers all the demands oi grammar and
logie· But as a matter os teste and feeling, 1 cannot receive it.
Such an apology for the unworthinesr of his sulpect at the com·
mencement of the biography,ill accords with the tone of dignified
confideuce which pervadas the memoir. The best commentary
lhave seen on the passage 'is that of Wr.; and it would not,
