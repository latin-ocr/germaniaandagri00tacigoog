which it is hoped may serve to exhibit the author in his minden
to the history, and especially to the literature, of his age.

4. The department in which less remained to be done than Ι

any other, for the elucidation of Tacitus, was that of Geography.
History, and Archaeology. The copious notes of Gordon and
Murphy left little to be desired in this line; and these notes are
not only accessible to American scholars iu their original forms,
but have been incorporated, more or less,'into all the college
editions. If any peculiar merit attaches to tbis edition, in this
department, it will be found in the frequent references tn such
classic authors as furnish collateral information, and in the
illustration of the private life of the Romans, by the help of such
recent works as Becker’s Gallus. The editor has also been
able to avail himself of Sharon Turner’s History of the Anglo
Saxons, which sheds not a little light on the manners of the
Germane.

b. Many of the ablest commentaries on the Germania and
Agricola have appeared within a comparatively recent period,
some of them remarkable examples of critical acumen and
exegetical lact, and others, models of school and college
editions. lt has been the endeavor of the editor to bring down
the literatura pertaining to Tacitus to the present time, and to
embody in small compass the most valnable results of the
labors of such recent German editors as Grimm, Giinther,
Gruber, Kiessling, Dronke, Roth, Ruperti, and Walther,

The text is, in the main, that of Walther, though the other
editors just named have been consultad3 and in such minor
differences as exist between them, 1 have not hesitated to adopt
the reading which seemed best to accord with the usage and
genius of Tacitus, especially when sanctioned by a decided pre·
ponderance of critical suffrage. Other readings have been
referred to in the Notes, so far as they are of any considerable
importance, or supported by respectable authority. Partly for
convenience, but chiefly as a matter ostenta, 1 have ventured
to follow the German editions in dispensing entirely with diacri-
tical marks, and in some peculiarities of less importance, which,
if not viswed with favor, it is hoped, will not be jndmd with
