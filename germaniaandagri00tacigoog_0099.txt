accountof German customs and institutione may, therefore, be
rehed on, from the intrinsic credibility ol the author. It receives
confirmation also, from its general accordance with other early
accounts of the Germana, and with their better known subse·
quent history, os well as irom its strong analogy to the well
lmown liabits of our American aborigines, und other tribes,
in a like stage of civilization (cl. note, l 15). The geographi·
cal details are composed with all the accuracy, which the ever
shisting positione and relations of warring and wandering tribes
rendered possible, in the nature of the case (cl. note, i 28).
In sentiment, the Treatise is surpassingly rich and instructius,
like all the works of this prince ol philosophical historiens. ln
style, it is concise and nervous, yet quite rhetorical, and in

Germany3 we beccum familiar with these so called Barbariaus;
we pardon their laults, and almost their vices, out ol regard tu
their virtues; and in our momente of enthusiasm, we even wish
we were Germeus.’'

The following remarks of Murphy will illustrate the value
ol the treatise, to modern lluropeans and their descendants.
“Itis a draught of savage manners, delineuted by amasterly
hand3 the more interesting, as the pert ol the world which it
describes, was the sem'inary ol the modern Europeau nations,
the Vacuus Gaurion, as historiens have emphatically called it.
The work is short, but, as Montesquieu observes, itis the work
of a man, who abridged everything, became he knew every·
thing. A thorough knowledge of the transactione ol barbarous
eges will throw more light than is generally imagiued on
