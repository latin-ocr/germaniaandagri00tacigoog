,obscure passage isaafollows: For they acere cornpelladin mochery
tc sit by their own grenones closed (by the Roman officere) aad to

dayam rrecdlessly (lit. gratuitously‚ cf. nota on auro, G. 28), i.
e. buy it at the public storehouses of the Romans, when they had
enough of their own if they only might use it, and finally ιο sall

their coru (to the Romans) ut a fised price (prescribed by the
purchasers). SoDr. and R. But W. and Wr. refer horreis to
the warehouses ol the Romans. And the latter explains aa
follows: “ They, who had brought their assessment of corn to the
Roman warehouses, were detained in mcckery, waiting for their
garn to be received—why? because they were either required to
tmusport their corn to some distant warehouse (as explained
further on, longinquitas, etc), or their corn was rejected
altogether. Το avoid these annoyances and insulta, the pro-
vincials alien preferred to retain their own corn aud buy of the
Romans, though at bigher prices, because tha expense os trans·
portatico was reckoned” (and added to the price). Of aanor
pretia hc gives uo rendering, and no explanation but the generd
one, involved in this paraphrase.

Dauortiu itirurum. Bye reuda explained by criu, as lougin-
quitus is by remoto. The object of requiring the people to convoy
their contributions to such distant and inconvenient points, was
to compel them to pay almost any samos many tc avoid coru·
pliance. Tha render of Cic. will remember in illustration of this
whole passage, the various arts to which Verres is said to have
bad reconna to enrich himself, at the expense of the people of his
province (Cic. in Ver. 3, 72, and 82), such as refusing to accept
the contributione they brought, ohliging them to buy of him at
his own price, requiring them to carry supplies to points most
distarn and difficult of noceas, ut ooeturue dffcultute ud mmm vel·
