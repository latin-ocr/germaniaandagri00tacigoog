In enumerating the several German Tribes (with which the
remainder oi· the Treatise is occupied), T. observes the follow·
ing order: l. Tribes not properly Germane, l 283 2. Those
duelling on the Rhine towards the west, 29-34; 3. Those
dwelliog on the Rhina towards the north, att-373 4. The Suevian
Allienoe, 38-403 h. Thone dwelling on the Danube, 41-43;
6. Those dwelling near tha Northern Ocean‚ iat-tm ’7. People
beyond that Ocean, 46. Pase. German critice have expended
much labor and macaron, in defining more exactly the locality
of tha original Tribee. ln so doing, they rely not only on
historical data, hut also on ure traces of ancient names etill
attached to cibes, foreste, mountaine‚ and other localities (cl.
note h 16). These we shall sometimes advert to iu the notes.
But on the whole, these speculatione ol German antiquariane
are not only lees interesting to scholare in other countrier‚ but
-are eo unsatisfactory and contradictory among themselves,.that‚
ior tha most part, we shall pase them over with very little atten-
tion. There is manifestly an intrinsic difficulty in defining the
ever changing limite oi uncivilized and unsettled tribes. Hence
the irreconcilable contradictione between emieat amioum, as
well ae modern critiques on this subject.

XXVIII. Summus auctorum, i. e. omnium scriptorum is, qui
plurimum auctoritatis fideique habet, Κ., ci. Sueton. Caes. 56.
Though T. commende eo highly the authority oi Caesar ae a
writer, yet he differe from him in not a few madere oi fact, ae

well as opinion ; owing chiefly, doubtless, to the increesed means
oi informatiou which he possessed in the age oi Trajan
