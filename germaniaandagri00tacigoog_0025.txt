sfiloe of Quindecimvir and Praetor (Ann. ii. 11). Beyond
mss vngue noricos, we know little or nothing ol his course
oi life, except that Pliny says (Epist. iv. 13), he was much
esteenred by the learned and the great at Rome, who went in
crowds to his levees. Oi the time of his death, we can only
conjecture, that he died before the Emperor Trajan, bnt alter
his friend Pliny-the former, because, bad he outlived tbe
Emperor, be would probably have exeoumd his purpose oi
writing the history of his reign (His. i. l) 3 the latter, because,
it he bad not survived his friend, Pliny, who lamented the
death ot so many othere, would not have failedto pay the last
tributetothe memoryolTacitus. - â€ž
It is generally admitted, though without direct testimony, '
that Tacitus died not without issue. That excollent prinde,
M. Claudius Tacitus, deduoed his pedigree from the historiam
and ordered bis imago to be set up, and a complete collection
ot his works tc be placed in the public archives, with a special
directim that twelve copies should be made every year at the
public expense. It is greatlyto be regretted that euch praise-
worthy precautions should have failed to preserve for us that
treasure entire! ..
The ageos Tacitus is usually styled the silver age ol Romen
Litereture3 and it merits no higher title, when compared
with the golden age ol Augustus. It was the good. senune
ol Augustus to gain the supremacy at Rome, when society
had reached ite maximnm ol retinement, and was just ready to
enter upon its stage ol corruption and decline. Hence his
name is identified with that pmnd era in literature, in producing
which he bore at best only an occidental and secondary part.
In the literature of the Augustan age, we admire the substance
oi learning and philosophy without the show, the cultivation
ot aste without the pusde oi criticism, the fascination ol poetry
