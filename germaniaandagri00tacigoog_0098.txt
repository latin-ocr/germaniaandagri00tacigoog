imperial power, was at the head of the Roman armies in
Germany, where he also remeinediore year or more aster hle
accession to the throne, till he had received the submissiones
the hostile tribes and wiped away the disgraoe which the
Germane, beyond any other nation of that age, had brought

upon the Roman arms. Such a people, et such a time, could
not fail to be en object ol deep intereat at Rome. This was the
tirne when Tacitus published his work on Germany; and such
are believed to have been the motives end the circumstances,
which led to the undertaking. His grand object was not to
point a satire or to compass a politioal end, but, as he himself
informs us (p 2¹¹1), to trent oi the origin and manners, the
geography and history, of the German Tribes.

The seme candor end sincerity, the seme correctness end
trutbfnlness, which characterize the History, mark also the
work on Germany. The author certainly aimed to speak the
trnth, and nothing bnt the truth, on the subjectos which he
treats. Moraover, he had abundent means ol knowing the
truth, on all the main points, in the character and history os the
Germane. It has even been argued from such expressions aa
vidimus (p 8), that Tacitus had himself been in Germany, and
could, therefore, write from personal observation. But the
argument proceeds on e misinterpretation of his langnngc (ci.
note in loc. cit). And the use of ecepimus (as in b 27),
shows thet he derived his information from others. But the
Romans had been in constant intercourse and connexion, civil
or military, with the Germane, for two hundred years. Germeny
inrnished a wide theatra for their greatest commendere, and a
fruitlni theme for their beet authors, some ol whom, as Julius
Caesar (to whom Tacitus particularly refers, 28), were them·
salves the chief actore in what they relate. These authors,
some oi whose contributione to the history of Germeny are now
lost (e. g. the elder Pliny, who wrote twenty books on the
German ware), must have all been in the hands of Tacitus, end
were, doubtless, consulted by him, not, however, as a servile
copyist or mere compiler (lor he sometimes differs from his
authorities, from Caesar even, whom he declares to be the best
oi them), but aa adiscnminating and judicioua inquiren. 'l'hs
