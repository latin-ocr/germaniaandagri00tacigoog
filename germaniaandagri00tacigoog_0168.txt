roriconi. tea

Orcadas. The Orkneys. Their name occurs earlier man
deis, bnt they were little known.

Dirpecta est. Was seen. The words mean no more than
this in T, cl. His. 4, bb: dispectores Gallias, etc.

Thule. Al. Thyle. What lsland T. meant, is uncertain. It
has been referred hy different critice, to the Shetland the
Hebrides‚ and even to leeland. The account oi the island, like
that oi the surrounding ocean, is obviously drawn from the
imagination.

Hactenus, sc. ut dispici posset, i. e. wintry storms and rnows
preeailed to such an extent only, that it could still be seen. So R.
Most Editors understand it, as an adv. of time. But this does
notaccord sowell with the usus loquendi of T. (cl. G. 25); and
il this clause be so understood, there is no propriety in using sed
at the beginning ol the next.

Appetebat. Al. abdebat. Appetebat rests on the better authority.
It may be taken in the sense either oi approaching or assailing,
ct‘. Cic. de Nat. D. 2, 39: mare terram appetens.

Sed. This introduces a reason, why the island was only seen,
not visited. The connexiones thought seems to he this: The
storms ol winter were approaching, not however so as to prevent
its being seem bnt the state ol the ocean effectually forhad nearer
acccsstoit.

Pigrnm et grece. See a similar description of the Northem
Ooeau. G. 45: pigrum ac prope immotum. The modern reader
need not be informed, that this is an entire mutale, as to the
matter oi lact3 those scas about Britain are never srozen;
though th'e navigatore in this voyage might easily have magni·
hed the perils and hardslrips of their enterprise, by transferring
to these waters what they had heard ol those further north.

Perinde. Al. proinde These two forms are written indis·
criminately in theold MSS. The meaning ol ne perinde here is
not so much, sc. as other seas3 the other member iu the com·
parison being omitted, as T. usually omits it with perinde and

not unlrequently with other words. For positiones ᾳιιὶᾰαη,

ὤλεο. dene-auore. Directly the reverse oi the truth. Those

reas, are in lact, remarkahly tempestuose.
