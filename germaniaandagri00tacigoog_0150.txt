Tua Biography of Agricola was written early in the reign od
Trajan (which commenced A. U. C. 861. A. D. 98), conse-
quently about the same time with the Germania, though perhaps
somewhat later (cs. notes on G.). This date is establishedhy
inference from the author’s own languagc in the 3d aud the etth
sections (see notes). Inthe former, he speaks of the dawn os abet·
ter day, which opened 'indeed with the reign os Nerva, but which
is now brightening constantly under the auspices of Trajan,
The use os the post tense (miscuerit) here in respectio Nerva,

clusive evidence, that at the time of writing, the reign of Nerva

was past, and that of Trajan had already began.

The other passage is, if possible, still more clearly demonstra·
tiva oi the same date. Here in drawing the same muhast
between past tyranny and present freedom, the author, without
mentioning Nerva, records the desire and hope, which his fallier·
in-law expressed in his hearing, that he might live to sce
Trajan elevated to the imperial throne-language very proper

and courtly, is Trajan were already Emperor, hut a very awkwnd
compliment to Nerva, is, as many critdcs suppose, he were still
the reiguing prinae.

It is objected to this date, that if Nerva were not still living, T,
could not have sailed to attach to his name (iu j 3.) the epithet
Dima, with which deceased Emperors were usually honored.
And from the omission of this epithet in connexion with the
name of Nereo, together with the terma os honor in which
Trajan is mentioned, it is inserted that the piece was written in
that brief periodos three months, which iuterveued between tho
adoption oi Trajan by Nerva, and Nerva’s death (see Br. Κγτ
