The history of Agricola during this period is of course the
history os Britain. Accordingly, the author presaces it with an
outline os the geographical features, the situation, soil, climate,
productione, and sofar as known to the Romans, the past history
oi the island. Tacitus possessed peculiar advantnges sor being
the historiari oi the early Britons. His father-in·law was the
first to subject the whole island to the sway oi Rome. He
traversed the country irom south to north at the head oi his

all historiens an account, too briei though it be, os the origin aud
antiquities oi the people that oi all others now exert the widest

dominion whether iu the political or the moral world, aud that have
made those countries which were in bis day shrouded in dark-
ness, the radiant points ior the moral and spiritual illuminatior
oi our race. “The child is father to the man,” and if we would
at this day investigate the elements oi English law, we bave it
