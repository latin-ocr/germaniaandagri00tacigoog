Ascire, al. accire. To receive into regular service. The reser-
enee is to the transfer oi soldiers from the supernumeraries to
the legions. So W. followed by Dr. R. and Wr. 'l'he next
clause implies‚ that he took care to receive into the service none

poeno-carucatas esse, we have a less doubtful example of the
same figure, where Ε. supplies uti with poena, and where we
should say in English: he did not always insidat punishment, but

the zeugma, giving the idea thus : lae mare frequently eoas satisfied
with repentem, and did not denand satisfactione by punishment.
