perhaps, he giving more space to so mooted a question, than the
scholar requires, to extract it entire: ‘⁶ Venia,” he says, “ is here
nothing else, than what we, in the language os modesty, call an
apology, and has respect to the very justificatiou he has just
offiered in the foregoing exordium. For T. there appeals to the
usage, not of remote antiquity only, but os later timos also, to
justisy his design ol writing the biography oi a distinguished
man. There would have been no need of such an apology in
other times. ln other times, dispensing with all preamble, he
would have begnn, as in d 4: Gnaeus Julius A, eto, essured
that no one would question the proprietyof his course. But now,
aster a long and servile silence, when one begins again faeta
mmesqru posteris trudere, when he utters the first word where
speech and almost memory (l 2) had so long been lost, when he
stands forth ns the first vindicator os condemned virtue, he seems
to venture on something so new, so strange, so bold, that it moy
well require apology.” In commentiug upon cursaturus-iem·
pora, Wr. adds: “ If there is uny boldness in the uuthor's use of
words here, that very fact suits the connexion, that hythe com·
plexion of his lunguuge even, he might paint the audacity cur·
sandi tam suero et infesta virtutibus temporo-of running over
(as in a race, for such is Wr.’s interpretation of cursando) times
so cruel and so hostile to virtue. Not, that those times could
excite in T. any real personal sear, for they were pust, and he
could now think what he pleased and speak what he thought
(His. 1, l). Still he shudders at the recollection os those
oruelties3 and he treads with trembling sootstep‚ as it were,
even the path lately,obstrncted by them. He looks about him to
see whether, even now, he may sasely utter his voice, and he
timidly asks pardon lor venturing to break the reigning silence.”

II. Legimus. Quis? Tacitus ejusdemque aetatis homines
alii. Ubii In actis diurnis. Wr. These jourrwls (Fiske’s Meu.
p. 626, 4. ed.) published such events (of. Dio. 67, 1].), andwere
read through the Empire (Anu. 16, 22). T. was absent hom
Rome when the events here referred to took place (oi. 45: longae
absentiae). Hence the propriety os his ssying legimus, rather

than vidimus or meminimus, which have‘ been·proposed ue oo‘r-
rectione. ·’ ”
