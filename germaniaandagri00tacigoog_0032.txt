of laconico. No book would give you more ideas in sewen
words. Nowhere could you guin so much knowledge, end
lose so little time. 'l'he render of Tacitus, who will study him

with pen in hand, to mark, or refer to the most striking pes·
seges, will soon find himself mester of e text book in morel
end politicsl science, we might soy u text book in humen

nature, singulorly concise end sententious, end what is not

always true even of concise end sententious writers, ss singulsrly
wise and prolound. In such e book, msny of the speeches would
find e place entire; for many of them ere little else then
e series of condensed‚ well-timed, and most instructive
opothegms.*

But the scholar, who is on the lookout, will find lurking in
every section, ond almost every sentence, some importent truth
in morale, in politice, in the individue] or sociel nature of man.
Neither the editor nor the teecher cen be expected to deuelope
these sentiments, nor even, in meny instantes, to point them
out. Thet lebor must be performed by the scholnr3 end his
will be the reward.

No hesty perussl, no· single reading os Tacitus, will give e
just conception os the surpassing richness ot his worhs. They
must be studied profoundly to be duly apprecieted. They ere
e mine of wisdom‚ of vest extent end unknown depth, whose
treesures lie chiefly beneeth the surlace, imbedded in the solid
meli, which must be entered with mining implements‚ explored
with strong lights, end its weelth brought up by severe toil
end went. ·
