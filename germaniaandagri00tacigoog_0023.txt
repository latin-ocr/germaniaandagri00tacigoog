Tacitus was edumted for the bar, and continued to plead
causes, occasionally at least, and with not a little success,
caen ester he had entered upon tho great business of his life,
as a writer ol history. We find references to his first, and
perhaps his last appearance, as au advocate, in the letters of
Pliny, which are highly complimentary. Thc first was, when
Pliny was niuetcen, and Tacitus a little older (how much we
are not informari), when Tacitus distinguished himself, so as
to awslren thc emulation and the euvy‚ though not in a had
sense, of Pliny. The last was some twenty years later, when
Tacitus aud Pliny, the tried friends of a whole lile, the brightsst
ornaments of literature and of the forum, were associated by
the cholce of the Senam, and pleaded together at the ber of
the Sedete, and in thc presence of the Emperor Trajan, for
the execution of justice upon Marius Priscus, who was
accused of mal-administration in the proconsulship of Africa.
Pliny says, that Tacitus spolie with singular grevity and
eloquence, and the Semta passed a unanimous vote of appro-.
bation and thonius to both the oratore, for the ability aud sucs
cess with which they had managed the prosecution (Plin.
Epis. ii. 11). Δ

We have also the commeuts of Pliny on a panegyrical
oration, which Tacitus pronounced‚ when consul, upon his
predecessor in the consular office, Verginius Rufus, perhaps
the most remarkable man of his ago, distinguished slike as
altero, a statumen, and a scholar, and yet so modest or so
wisc that hc repeatedly refused the offer of the imperial purple.
“Tortuue,’' says Pliny, “always faithful to Verginius, reservet
for her lest favor, such au orator to pronounce a eulogium on

such vimuee. It was enough'to crown the glory of a well
spent life” (Plin. Epis. ii. 1).
