LIFll illl TACITUS.

mm

In is the office of genius and learning, ascl lightto illustrate
other things, and not itself. Tha writers, who, os all othere
perhaps, bave told us most of the world, justas it has been
aud is, bave told ns least of themselves. Their character we
may infer, with more or less exactness, from their worlrs‚ bnt
their history is uuwritten and must lor ever romain so. Homer,
though, perhaps, the only one who has been argued out ni
existence, is by no means the only one whose age and birth·
place have been disputed. The native place oi Tacitus is

mers matter of conjecture. His parentage is not certainly
known. The time of his birth and the year ol his death are

ascertained only by approximation, and very saw incidente are
recorded iu the history ol his lile; still we lrnow the period in
which he lived, the influences under which his character was
developed and matured‚ and the circumstances under which be
wrote his immortal works. In short, we know his timer,
though we can scarcely guther up enough to denominate hin
lise,· and the times in which an author lived, are osten an
important, not to say, essentia] meana oi elucidating bis
writings.

Carus Couunnrns Tacrnns was born in the early part of the
reign os Nero, and near the middle of the first century in the
Christian Era. The probability is, that he was the son ol
Cornelius Tacitus, a man ol equestrian rank, and procurator
of Belgio Gaul under Ncr03 that hs was born at Interamna
