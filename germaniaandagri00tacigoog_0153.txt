With the retirement of A. from the command in Britain, the
author falls back more into the province os biography. The
few occasional strokee, however, in which the pencil of Τ. has
sketched the character ol Domitian in the back grourul of the
picture os A. arethe more to be prized, because his history oi
diat reign ie lost.

ln narrating the ⁸closing soenes of Agricola’s lile, Τ. breatbes
the very spirit of an affectionate son, without sacrificing the
impartiality and gravity of the historian, and combines all a
mourner’s simplicity and ‘sincerity with all the orator's dignity
and elequence.
